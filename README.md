### Professional Introduction
I am a transitioning professional dedicated to mastering the technical and ethical requirements of the 2026 cybersecurity landscape. My specialization focus will be digital forensics and red teaming.

### Cybersecurity Focus: Red Teaming & Digital Forensics
My professional trajectory is centered on the dual-disciplines of offensive security and post-incident reconstruction. 

* **Red Teaming:** I am focused on mastering adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to identify systemic vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious actors.
* **Digital Forensics:** Complementing my offensive interest, I am developing skills in host and network forensics to perform deep-dive analysis of security breaches, ensuring evidence integrity and comprehensive root-cause identification.
